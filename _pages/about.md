I'm a first-year Phd Student in the National 'AI for Society' at University of Pisa, Italy.

Currently, I'm associated to <a href = "https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/">Ubiquitous Internet</a> Lab at IIT-CNR in Pisa, working on the following research topics:

* <b>Hybrid Intelligence</b>
* <b>Neurosymbolic AI</b>
* <b>Reinforcement Learning<b>

In a summary, the main goal of my research is to enhance human-AI collaboration in heterogenous teams to accomplish difficult tasks based on a combination of perception and reasoning skills (e.g. autonomous driving). The study explores neurosymbolic approaches as a better alternative to only-neural frameworks (so called "black box") in order to achieve model explainability, training efficiency and better generalization.

If you are an AI practitioner in this or a similar area, feel free to contact me via e-mail on connect on <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitoscaraggi/">Linkedin</a>.

Finally, a motivational quote for you, researcher of whatever:

"
Nobody ever figures out what life is all about,
and it doesnâ€™t matter.
Explore the world.
Nearly everything is really interesting
if you go into it deeply enough.
"
