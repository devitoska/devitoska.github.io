I'm a first-year Phd Student in the Italian National Program 'AI for Society' at University of Pisa, Italy.

Currently, I'm a research fellow in the <a href = "https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/">Ubiquitous Internet</a> Lab at IIT-CNR in Pisa, working on the following topics:

* <b>Hybrid Intelligence</b>
* <b>Neurosymbolic AI</b>
* <b>Reinforcement Learning<b>

In a summary, the main goal of my research is to enhance human-AI collaboration in heterogenous teams to accomplish difficult tasks based on a combination of perception and reasoning skills (e.g. autonomous driving). The study explores neurosymbolic approaches as a better alternative to only-neural frameworks (so called "black box") in order to achieve model explainability, training efficiency and better generalization.
