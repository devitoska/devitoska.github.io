In my mind, this blog will serve as a diary of my PhD journey, collecting stuff and interesting findings in my research area, i.e. mainly Reinforcement Learning and NeuroSymbolic AI, with some unpredictable digressions. Knowing me, I will not publish constantly. New posts will come at random intervals, as I find new topics to discuss (not so hard) and time to write (main problem at the moment). While "I wait for the stars to align", I invite you (is there anyone out there?) to contact me about AI research and to contribute to this blog. 

To the next(?) post,

Vito
