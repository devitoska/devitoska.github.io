I was scrolling through my YouTube feed when I came across Writing Doom (2024), an "Award-winning Short Film on Super Intelligence" as the title says. Watched it all the way through to the credits and let me say: kudos to the actors and the production 👏👏👏 Best entertaining content on AI I've seen in a while. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the topic, regardless of their background (only one character is an AI researcher, and he does not speak technical).

Without making any spoiler, the short tells the story of a group of writers brainstorming for a new season of a TV show that will feature Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), a hypothetical agent that surpasses human cognitive abilities (look up Nick Bostrom for more on that). Most everyday discussions on ASI end up with deadly humanoid robots 🤖🔪 turning against humans and taking over the world, which kind of makes the topic sound ridiculous and far from being a problem. However, we should recognize that a misaligned intellect, one we might not even have the tools to fully understand (like modern language models), that is capable of pursuing its own goals, may not necessarily cause extinction ☠, but is extremely dangerous ⚠️⚠️⚠️ .

That said, enjoy! The short is a comedy, with plenty of funny moments that make you both laugh and reflect on subjects of immense importance for all of us!

P.S. Thanks to the Youtube recommender system, fortunately still narrow AI (I hope 🤔), that kindly suggested it to me.
